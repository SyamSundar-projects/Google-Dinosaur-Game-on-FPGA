# Google-Dinosaur-Game-using-FPGA
I implemented Google Dinosaur Game by interfacing keyboard(to give commands),monitor(to display status of game),an USB interface to connect keyboard with FPGA(as processor),VGA interface to connect moniter with FPGA.I wrote seperate codes to interface and run each peripherals.I uploaded all these codes in repository and our game report.
